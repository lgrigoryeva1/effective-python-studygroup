# Effective Python Study Circle

Notes and sample code for the Effective Python study circle hosted by Turku.py in spring 2020. The code examples use Python 3.7.

## Chapters
1. Pythonic Thinking
2. Functions
3. ...

## Running the examples
To run the example code in for example `/functions/itering.py`, call `python functions/itering.py` using python 3. If you get errors, the correct command might be `python3` instead of `python`(since only `python` often refers to python 2).
